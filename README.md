# NightOwl
Developed by Johnnie Vu, Oz  Chicas, TJ Roncal & Alejandro Bermudez on June 9, 2023

## Description
We wanted to make a web app that would enable users to search or post different events happening throughout the evening. For the design we opted for a dark modern theme that would be easy on the eyes, as well as provide intuitive functionality for the user. 

Whether you're looking for a house party, art exhibition, or social gathering, NightOwl provides a platform for organizing and promoting events of all sizes. By connecting event organizers with attendees, NightOwl aims to foster meaningful connections through memorable experiences.

## Getting Started
NightOwl is a web application designed to help users discover and post various evening events. Getting started with NightOwl is a breeze, simply sign-up to unlock a world of possibilities! Browse the Landing Page to discover events that match your interests. Then click on an event to view the details and decide if it's something you'd like to attend. 

Want to host your own event? Post it with all the necessary details on the Post an Event tab. Clicking "Submit" will then direct you to an Event Details page where you can Edit or Delete the event. When back on the Landing Page you'll see your unique event listed among other exciting offerings! 

## Ice Box Features
Some of the enhancements we would like to add to NightOwl are as follows:
* Add search functionality where users can look up different events
* Permit users to monetize events that they host
* Give users the option to bookmark events
* Implement a Calendar API where users can mark upcoming events
* Grant access to metrics regarding events across the app
* Detail a friends function where users can follow and interact with other users
